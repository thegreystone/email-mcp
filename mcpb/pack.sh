#   output    path of the bundle to write
#
# Used by the release workflow (one bundle per native image) and by the manual "Bundles" workflow that
# builds bundles for an already published release. Run it on the platform that owns the binary: the
# executable bit is taken from the file, and a Unix binary packed on Windows would lose it.
